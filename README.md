# _TSIM7000G Gateway Code for Mesh Network_

This project is for the capstone implementation entitled "Development and Integration of Energy-Adaptive Wireless Mesh Network for Water Quality Monitoring Systems in Aquaculture Applications". This is for ESP-based MCUs, specifically for Lilygo TSIM7000G, in utilization of the UART ports for the sim card module and another connected MCU for Meshtastic purposes.
